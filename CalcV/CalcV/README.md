# My Web Project

This project is a simple web application that calculates the total probability of two events based on the theorem of addition of probabilities. It provides a user-friendly interface for inputting probabilities and displaying the calculated results.

## Files Overview

- **src/CalcVb.js**: Contains functions to calculate the total probability of two events and round the results to four decimal places.
  
- **src/index.html**: The entry point of the web application, which includes references to the JavaScript and CSS files, and provides the user interface for inputting probabilities.

- **src/styles/styles.css**: Defines the visual appearance of the web application, including layout, colors, and fonts.

## How to Run the Application

1. Clone the repository or download the project files.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
3. Input the probabilities for events A and B in the provided fields.
4. Click the button to calculate the total probability.
5. The result will be displayed on the page.
